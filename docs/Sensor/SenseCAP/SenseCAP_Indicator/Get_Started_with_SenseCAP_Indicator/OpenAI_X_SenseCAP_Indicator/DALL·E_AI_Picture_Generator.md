# **DALL·E AI Picture Generator**

DALL-E is an advanced AI model developed by OpenAI that can generate images from textual descriptions. DALL-E has been trained on a massive dataset of images and their corresponding textual descriptions. 

Given a textual prompt, DALL-E can generate a unique image that matches the description. The model has demonstrated impressive capabilities, such as generating images of fictional creatures, objects, and scenes that do not exist in the real world. DALL-E has potential applications in various fields, including art, design, and advertising.
